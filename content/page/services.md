During my professional career I've collected vast experience in implementing novel Machine Learning solutions in the financial industry. The disruptive nature of Fintech meant that I had to come up with novel solutions to doing classic credit scoring. For the past couple of years I've been mainly working on the creation of highly predictive variables based solely on bank account data. 

Moreover, I've developed and assessmed various types of non-classical scoring models that aimed at automating loan processing while providing high predictive power. They were proved to meet their ambitious goals both internally, as well as with external partners and institutions.

My main areas of financial services modelling expertise are:

* aggregating raw bank account transactions into higher level attributes
* classifying bank account transactions with neural networks
* applying unsupervised ML techniques to bank account transaction descriptions
* modelling and forecasting bank account EDB (Ending-Day-Balance) time-series
* performing EDB time-series clustering and classification

All of the above result in the creation of powerfull and highly predictive scoring attributes based solely on bank account transactional data. 

Please reach out to me if you collect bank accout data and wish to enhance your current scoring models, but are unsure how to best go about it.
